## Safari extension for Logseq

This is a Safari web clipping extension for Logseq. It allows you to clip highlights and parts of webpages over to logseq and add it to your notes.

### Credits
- Credits to @hkgnp for his chrome and firefox extensions for logseq, which I used as a base for this extension.
